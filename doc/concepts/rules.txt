This file lists the most important ny concepts, guidelines and design rules.
All of those guidelines are changeable, but not instantly in the code, first it shall be
notices here and changes are only allowed after a constructive discussion.
Note that some of the ny guidelines may change slightly during releases.
Those points are not (yet) really ordered by importance.

- the implementation has to follow the interfaces. Of course must the interfaces be
  implementable, but they shall not be designed after the final implementations (which may
  change).
- good interfaces. Easy to use right, hard to use wrong. Everything in C++ is allowed, legacy
  things like macros or heavily relaying on the preprocessor are not desired. The interfaces
  shall be as easy as possible. C pods are as desirable as complex virtual template interface
  idioms. Always choose the best solution on the whole.
- ny is built modular. The individual modules shall be as independent as possible and
  all of them shall be reasonable on their own. All modules shall be as generic as possible.
  Easy integration with other libraries/concepts/idioms/language techniques is always desirable.
- ny is a highly reactive and changeable interfaces, if one wants a static stable library which
  does not change its core even if it would gain great profits they can still go with other, older
  gui libs.
- raii is usually the best way to go. There may be cases where it is not the best solution (rare),
  but there have to be serious reasons to not go with raii
- ny is exceptions safe, all interfaces are designed against exceptions and all implementations are
  written exception safe, unknowing which functions might throw (except when trying to catch an
  exception)
- ny is always as soon as ration updated to the new standards, tries to use stl where possible
  and tries to never reimplement or use reimplemented stl classes
- ny tries to go with as few external dependencies as possible
- ny generally tries to go with existent standard where possible
- everything shall be documented inside the code (mainly header files but impl docs are also
  desirable), for added features examples are always useful
- ny follows the concepts of open source and free software and shall not be the personal project
  by one (or few) people; it shall therefore always stay theoretically independent from larger
  projects (-> ny desktop concept shall not directly influence the library itself)

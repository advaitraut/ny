# ny

A lightweight and modern C++14 windowing toolkit.
Licensed under the __Boost License__ (similar to MIT and BSD license but does not require
attribution when only used in binaries).

**_Under Construction_**

For some first sketchup of how ny will/could look, see the first [docs](doc) or some
really basic [example apps](src/examples).
The examples are of course available under public domain.
All kinds of contributions are appreciated.
